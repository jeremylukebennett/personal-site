            <h2>Saturday January 13th 2018</h2>

            Blog post one! I’ve finally started the 6 month immersive front-end development program at Nashville Software School. It’s been a long time coming. So.. what are my impressions?
            The first week and a half was fairly straight-forward. Mostly clerical stuff, not a ton of coding (or at least not a ton of material 
            that wasn’t covered in the pre-work). To that end, I’ve really enjoyed the instruction on design we’ve been given so far. This is 
            material that was not covered in the pre-work, but is equally rigorous in its own way. I’ve been surprised at how challenging it is to 
            think honestly about the best ways to solve a problem. To even come up with a truly relevant problem to solve is a feat in and of itself. 
            I look forward to exploring these questions further.I definitely noticed some stress and anxiety when we began our first group project. Its difficult not to compare oneself to the people 
            around us, but this was the first time I was confronted directly with other people’s level of understanding in the program. I immediately 
            felt intimidated. Things that I thought were a slam-dunk for me in the pre-work seemed wholly abstract and ephemeral in practice. 
            And those in my group seemed to have a confidence and fluency that I felt I lacked. To a certain degree I think I was simply paired with 
            a great group of people, and it was difficult not to feel inferior with them (its worth noting that they were all extremely supportive 
            and cool). I was relieved at one point when I mentioned in passing that I felt like I was the weakest link in the group to hear them 
            respond with surprise. Maybe I’m just fooling myself? I don’t know. Either way, I think a feeling of discomfort in this context isn’t 
            the worst thing in the world. I think whatever it takes to remind me to question my understanding and learn more is useful at this point.
